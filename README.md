# yourASU extension

_Version 0.1.0_
<br>

### Introduction

Welcome to the yourASU Extension! <br>
_This extension allows full customization of the myASU website_ <br>
This extension is available for easy installation and automatic updates on the chrome extension store, I recommend installing from there 😁

### How To Use

This extension should be fairly straight forward to learn, but here is a guide anyway ✌️<br>
I recommend pinning the extension for easy access, but if unless you plan on changing the customization often, you don't need to. <br>
_This extension is only available on Google Chrome._ <br>

1. Navigate to the myASU website ([https://webapp4.asu.edu/myasu/student](https://webapp4.asu.edu/myasu/student))
2. If pinned, simply click on the extension's icon, otherwise, click the jigsaw puzzle piece to the right of the url bar, then click on 'yourASU' (you may have to scroll.)
3. Once open, start customizing!
4. The preset themes are on the left
5. If you wish to create your own theme, you can use the panel on the right, after clicking the 'Custom' theme preset.
